### Questions:
- How do the flight phases (ex. take off, cruise, landing..) contribute to fatalities? Chart!
- Which 5 states saw the most injuries in the US? Show it on a barchart!
- Which 5 aircraft models had the most injuries (fatal, serious, minor)? Show them on a piechart!
- What was the distribution of fatal injuries during the last 20 years? Show it on a barchart!
- What was the survival rate for substantial AND destroyed aircrafts since 1993? Compare it on two pie charts!
(take into account the three colums with non-fatal injuries)

### Notes:
- Be wary of missing data in the columns
- Injuries are counted from the _Total Serious Injuries_ and _Total Minor Injuries_ columns (by default fatal injuries are not counted here)
